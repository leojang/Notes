Fruit juice is not as nutritious as fresh fruit, but it can be a healthy part of your diet, if it's consumed in small portions.and potassium, which can be especially helpful if you tend to forgo fruit. Some store-bought juices are fortified with bone-building calcium, too. 

果汁並不像新鮮水果那樣有營養，但如果只喝少量，它可以成為你的健康飲食的一部分。

A glass of fresh orange or grapefruit juice with breakfast isn't just refreshing. It also delivers a healthy dose of vitamin C and potassium, which can be especially helpful if you tend to forgo fruit.  Some store-bought juices are fortified with bone-building calcium, too. 
 
早餐來一杯新鮮的橙汁或葡萄柚汁不僅令人提神。它還提供健康的維生素C和鉀，尤其是對不吃水果的人來說特別有用。一些商店買來的果汁也加強了鈣質添加。

But even when it contains only naturally occurring fructose from whole fruit and no added sugars to boost sweetness, fruit juice is still a concentrated source of sugar and calories, which can be problematic for those watching their weight or blood sugar.

但即使它僅含有從整個水果中提取的天然果糖，也沒有添加糖來增加甜度，但果汁仍然是糖和卡路里的濃縮來源，這對於那些觀察體重或血糖的人來說可能是有問題的。

For example, one 8-ounce cup of fresh orange juice has 21 grams of sugar and 112 calories. By comparison, one medium orange has 12 grams of sugar and only 62 calories. 

例如，一杯8盎司的鮮橙汁有21克糖和112卡的熱量。相比之下，一個中等尺寸的柳橙只有12克糖，62卡。

Similarly, a cup of cranberry juice has 28 grams of sugar and 110 calories, but a cup of whole cranberries has only 4 grams of sugar and 46 calories. The counts for grape juice are even higher, with 36 grams of sugar and 140 calories per 8-ounce cup. 

同樣的，一杯蔓越莓汁有28克糖和110卡的熱量，但一杯完整蔓越莓只有4克糖和46卡的熱量。葡萄汁的糖分更高，每8盎司杯含36克糖和140卡。

Fruit juice also lacks the fiber found in whole fruit, which means we not only miss getting the health benefits of fiber -- which include its ability to lower cholesterol and help us feel full -- we experience a more rapid rise in blood sugar after consuming juice, since fiber slows the entry of sugar into the bloodstream.

果汁也缺乏在完整水果中的纖維，這意味著我們不僅錯過了獲得纖維的健康益處 - 包括降低膽固醇並幫助我們感到飽滿 - 纖維會減慢糖分進入血液，我們在喝完果汁後我們的血糖會快速升高。
