Hello,

I've placed an order this morning (two Eulit Palma Perlon 2 pieces black 20mm), just want to make sure whether my order is confirmed or not. Since I've closed the web page while clicking the checkout button, I've checked my bank account, and it showed that my credit card was charged. 

I've used this email to make an order, the shipping address was sent to Taiwan. 
I would be appreciated if someone could check if my order is good or not.

Thank you.
