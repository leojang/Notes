and I’m confident that I can bring a lot of value.

Dear Ben

Thank you for offering me the job of software engineer at Pneuma Software. I'm very excited about this position and know that I'd be the right fit for your team.

My expected salary is in the $49,000 - $53,000 USD range, with the skill sets I have, this job is a perfect fit for me, I believe an offer of $49,000 USD will be more in line with my qualifications and still makes an win-win deal for both of us, knowing that I'll bring a lot of value to the table based on my experience. Also like you said before, compared to average salary of software engineers in the States, it's 50% less than the average. 

It would be more comfortable if we can settle on a monthly salary of $92000 - $95000 NTD for 14 months as base salary, total would be roughly $45,000 USD. The initial offer contains 3 months of performance bonus, we can make the performance bouns to just 1 month.

I can certainly see a future for myself at the company, I hope that we can come to a mutual agreement on an acceptable salary. 

Thank you for your time,

Best,
Leo
