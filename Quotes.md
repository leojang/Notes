It is important to test your own code: don't assume that some testing organization or user will find things for you. But it's easy to delude yourself about how carefully you are testing, so try to ignore the code and think of the hard cases, not the easy ones. To quote Don Knuth describing how he creates tests for the TEX formatter, "I get into the meanest, nastiest frame of mind that I can manage, and I write the nastiest [testing] code I can think of; then I turn around and embed that in even nastier constructions that are almost obscene."
