### What can you do for this company?

First of all, be sure to have researched the company prior to the interview, so you are familiar with the company's mission. Try to identify the company’s specific needs, and then respond by giving examples as to why your education, skills, accomplishments, and experience will make you an asset for the employer in fulfilling these needs.

Take a few moments to compare your goals with the objectives of the company and the position, as well as mentioning what you have accomplished in your other jobs. Be positive and reiterate your interest in the company, as well as the job.

* Emphasize what you’ve accomplished in the past, and connect it to the future. Provide concrete examples from past jobs to show how you have contributed to other companies. Past examples show employers the kind of work you will likely do for them.Describe specific examples of how effective you have been in your other positions, changes you have implemented, and goals you have achieved.             * Talk about the depth and breadth of related experience that you have. However, you will want to conclude by explaining that you will bring these kinds of accomplishments to this current company.
* Use data. Interviewers ask this question because they want to know how you will add value to the company. To show this, you might want to use numbers to show how you have added value in the past. For example, did you increase a company’s sales record by a certain percentage? Did you raise a certain amount of funds for an organization? Numbers offer a concrete example of how you have contributed to a company, and how you will likely contribute in the future.
* Connect your answer to the employer’s goals. Whatever examples you focus on, make sure they are related to the particular job and/or company. You will want to let the interviewer know that you have the skills necessary to do the job they are hiring for, the ability to effectively meet challenges, and the flexibility and diplomacy to work well with other employees and with management. If there are any specific qualities or skills that are particularly important for this job or company, focus on these.

### What were your responsibilities at your current (or last) position?

* The best way to respond to this question is to describe your responsibilities in detail and to connect them to the job you are interviewing for.

* Focus most on your responsibilities that are directly related to the new job's requirements. 

* Be descriptive and engaging in your summary of responsibilities

* Mention any specific instances where you benefited the company, solved a problem or had a major accomplishment.

In my 15 years of experience as a sales manager, I have developed strong motivational and team-building skills. I was twice awarded manager-of-the-year for my innovative strategies for motivating employees to meet and surpass quarterly deadlines. If hired, I will bring my leadership abilities and strategies for achieving profit gains to this position.”

Having served as a tutor at a summer school for dyslexic children for the past two years, I have developed my ability to be extremely patient while still achieving academic gains with my students. My experience teaching phonics to children ages 6 to 18 has taught me strategies for working with children of all ages and abilities, always with a smile. My previous employer often placed me with the students with the most severe learning disabilities because of my history of success. I will bring not only experience, but patience and creative problem-solving, to this position.”

My long-term goals involve growing with a company where I can continue to learn, take on additional responsibilities, and contribute as much value as I can. I love that your company emphasizes professional development opportunities. I intend to take advantage of all of these.

### Do You Prefer to Work Independently or On a Team?

“I am equally comfortable working as a member of a team and independently. In researching the LMN company, your mission statement, and the job description, I could see similarities to previous positions that I have held where some assignments required a great deal of independent work and research, while others were better completed as a group.

I continued to grow as a team member while on my sorority's debate team and through my advanced marketing class where we had numerous team assignments. Working on a team energizes me in a positive way, although I’m also confident in my ability to work alone when I need to.”

“I am comfortable working alone and in a group depending on the situation. If the task is easy enough to tackle on my own without requiring collective brainstorming, I am happy to work on my own. However, if the assignment is a high priority one or is too much for one person to handle, I welcome working with a team to tackle the project together. In my experience, most projects require a combination of independent work and brainstorming depending on their various elements.”

### How to Answer Interview Questions About Your Greatest Strength

How should you answer questions about your strengths? The best way to respond is to describe the skills and experience that you have which directly correlates with the job you are applying for. Be prepared to answer by making a list of the qualifications mentioned in the job posting. 

Then, make a list of your skills that match those listed. This list can include education or training, soft skills, hard skills, or past work experiences. Narrow your list of skills down to 3 - 5 particularly strong skills.

Next to each skill, note an example of how you have used that strength in the past.

### How Would You Describe Yourself?

When you respond, keep in mind the type of position you are interviewing for, the company culture, and the work environment. However, it's not a good idea to simply regurgitate a list of reasons why you are right for the position.

Instead, answer with a few positive adjectives or phrases that describe your personal characteristics or your attitude (sometimes employers ask a similar question, “What three adjectives would you use to describe yourself?”). Make sure to focus on the qualities that make you an ideal match for the job and the company.

You typically do not need to follow up your response with specific examples of times you have displayed each characteristic – often, an employer wants a relatively concise answer to this question. However, if you give your answer and the interviewer looks like her or she is waiting for more, you can then follow up with examples from past work experiences. The interviewer might even ask you outright to expand your answer with examples.Finally, while you should shape your answer to fit the particular job, authenticity is still important. Your response should be positive but genuine.


### How Do You Handle Stress?

Pressure is very important to me. Good pressure, such as having a lot of assignments to work on, or an upcoming deadline, helps me to stay motivated and productive. Of course, there are times when too much pressure can lead to stress; however, I am very skilled at balancing multiple projects and meeting deadlines, which prevents me from feeling stressed often. For example, I once had three large projects due in the same week, which was a lot of pressure. However, because I created a schedule that detailed how I would break down each project into small assignments, I completed all three projects ahead of time and avoided unnecessary stress.
